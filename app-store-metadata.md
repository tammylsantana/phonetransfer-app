## Review Notes for Apple
PhoneTransfer is a utility app that provides step-by-step guides for switching between phones (Android ↔ iPhone) and carriers. It does not perform any actual data transfer — it serves as an interactive checklist and guide. All content is generated on-device based on the user's selected phone direction and carriers. No account creation or login is required. No data is collected or transmitted. The app works entirely offline after download.
