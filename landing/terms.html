    <p>PhoneTransfer offers a one-time, non-consumable in-app purchase ("PhoneTransfer Pro") for $4.99 USD. Payment will
        be charged to your Apple ID account at the time of confirmation. This is a one-time purchase with no recurring
        charges or subscriptions.</p>

    <h2>3. Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>All purchases are processed through Apple's App Store. To request a refund, please visit <a
            href="https://reportaproblem.apple.com" target="_blank">reportaproblem.apple.com</a> or contact Apple
        Support.</p>

        <li>Reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from the App</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>The App is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee that the App will be error-free,
        uninterrupted, or that the information provided will be accurate or complete. Phone transfer processes vary by
        device and carrier, and results may differ.</p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>BTS Innovations LLC shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising
        from your use of the App, including but not limited to data loss during phone transfers.</p>

    <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App may reference third-party carriers, devices, and services. We are not affiliated with and do not endorse
        any third-party brands mentioned in the App. All trademarks belong to their respective owners.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Continued use of the App constitutes acceptance of
        modified Terms.</p>
