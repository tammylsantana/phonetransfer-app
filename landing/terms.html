        <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By downloading, installing, or using PhoneTransfer ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of
            Service.</p>

        <h2>Description of Service</h2>
        <p>PhoneTransfer is a mobile application that provides step-by-step guidance for transferring data between
            Android and iPhone devices and switching mobile carriers. The App is an informational guide and does not
            directly transfer any data between devices.</p>

        <h2>License</h2>
        <p>We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for personal,
            non-commercial use in accordance with these Terms and Apple's App Store Terms of Service.</p>

        <h2>Purchases</h2>
        <p>PhoneTransfer is available as a one-time purchase through the Apple App Store. All purchases are processed by
            Apple and are subject to Apple's terms and refund policies. We do not process payments directly.</p>

        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>PhoneTransfer provides general guidance based on publicly available information. While we strive to keep
            instructions accurate and up-to-date:</p>
        <p>The App is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. We do not guarantee that carrier processes, phone
            features, or transfer procedures will work exactly as described, as these may change without notice.</p>
        <p>We are not responsible for any data loss, service interruption, or other issues that may occur during your
            phone transfer or carrier switch. Always back up your data before making changes.</p>

        <p>All content in PhoneTransfer, including text, graphics, icons, and software, is our property and is protected
            by copyright and other intellectual property laws. Carrier names and logos mentioned in the App are
            trademarks of their respective owners.</p>

        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special,
            consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the App.</p>

        <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes
            acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
